- https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

Please create a React Native app consisting of an infinite scrolling list of items. Tapping on any of the items in the feed should open a full screen detail page showing all the available info and any associated media.

## Must-have features

- Infinite scrolling
- Pull to refresh
- Show item detail view when tapping on any item in the list

## Nice-to-have features

- Cache/Persist data locally across app launches
- Responsive UI wrt different device sizes

## Other notes

As much as reasonable, you ought to treat this project as if it’s a production app. Modularize your code, test when appropriate, comment where necessary and most importantly make sure your app performs well.

Also feel free to pull in 3rd party libraries as you see fit.

We will use your project to build and run locally on a simulator in XCode and emulator in Android Studio.

### Timeline

You have until 11:59pm PDT on Mon Jun 13 to complete this challenge. When you are ready, send a link to your github repo, or if you prefer, zip up the entire project directory and send it back. Thanks in advance for your hard work, and good luck!
